# The HAL service is `disabled` in its own init script and starts on nothing
# but this property, which the bootloader does not hand out - stock carries it
# in /system/build.prop. Without it the CXD224x never comes up, and the only
# symptom is NFC quietly not existing. The two japanese SKUs are the Sony part;
# h930 and the rest are NXP, so this cannot live in joan-common.

# FeliCa (Osaifu-Keitai). All prebuilt java - no boot jar, no resource library.
# These are the japanese SKUs' own, which is why they are here rather than in
# joan-common.
#
# MobileFeliCaClient will not start without the "felica" binder service, which
# on stock comes from LG's fork of packages/apps/Nfc. Here it is its own app,
# packages/apps/FelicaService, which forwards the element calls to the half
# that has to stay inside the nfc process. See docs/felica-port.md.
# The xml and cfg files are not listed here: extract_utils emits those as
# PRODUCT_COPY_FILES in joan_jp-vendor.mk, not as modules, so naming them
# only get them rejected as non-existent.
